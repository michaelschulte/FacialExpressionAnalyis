**Facial Expression Analysis with AFFDEX and FACET: A Validation Study**

The goal of this study was to validate AFFDEX and FACET, two software based algorithms to analyze emotional facial expressions. In Study 1, pictures of standardized emotional facial expressions from three databases, Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures (WSEFEP), Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES) and Radboud Faces Database (RaFD), were classified with both modules. Results show large variance in accuracy across emotions and databases with a performance advantage for FACET over AFFDEX. In Study 2, 110 respondentsâ€™ facial responses were measured while being exposed to emotionally evocative pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), Geneva Affective Picture Database (GAPED) and Radboud Faces Database (RaFD). Accuracy again differs for distinct emotions and results in better performance for FACET. Overall, iMotions can achieve acceptable accuracy for standardized pictures of prototypical (vs. natural) facial expressions, but only weak accuracy for more natural facial expressions. We discuss potential sources for limited validity and suggest research directions in the broader context of emotion research.
