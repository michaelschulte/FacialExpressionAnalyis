Instructions:
1. Ensure there are two folders: 'jpg' and 'output'
2. In the jpg folder, a child folder is required for each series of pictures
3. Ensure that a ffmpeg binary is present either in the PATH or in the folder itself.
(Get it from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html or from your preferred distribution system.)
4. Run from a unix shell using './ffmpeg.sh' or './ffmpeg_MK.sh'
(On windows: Use either the "Subsystem for UNIX-based applications" in Windows 10 or something like cygwin/MINGW64)
5. Enjoy the videos found in 'output'
